Updated `latexmk' based engines for TeXShop (3.77 and later). These engines use TeXShop's `parameter' directive and pass the information as command line options (e.g., --shell-escape) to the underlying typesetting engines ((pdf/lua/xe)latex). Included are sample `platexmkrc' files to see how they can be used for special processing. Updated engines for TeXShop 4.66+ have been added.
