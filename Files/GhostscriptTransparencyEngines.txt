Recent versions of Ghostscript need an extra argument to enable transparency for pstricks and processing by latex->dvips->ps2pdf. Enclosed are four engines (latexTR.engine, latexTRmk.engine, xelatexTR.engine and xelatexTRmk.engine) and two special rc file for the `mk' engines. Instructions of where to place the three files are enclosed. Note: The xelatex based engines need TeX Live 2021 (e.g., installed by MacTeX-2021) to run properly.
