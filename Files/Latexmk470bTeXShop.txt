Implementation of latexmk 4.70b for TeXShop. All files necessary to update to latexmk 4.70b from a previous version; includes latexmk 4.70b. Only the latexmk Perl Program itself has been updated. Engines allow a project configuration file called platexmkrc in the same directory as the project root file. The updated engine files that use TeXShop's `parameter' declaration from the 4.54 distribution are included.
