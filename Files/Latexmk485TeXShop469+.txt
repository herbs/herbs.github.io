Besides the original support files (already installed in TeXShop) this contains updated engines and support files using zsh rather than bash or sh and is meant to be used with TeXShop 4.69 and later. It also contains the latexmk version 4.85 Perl script written by John Collins. Finally, the engines have been updated to use the version of latexmk in the active TeX Distribution. If latexmk isn't found an internal, possibly older version, of latexmk will be used. The version supplied with this folder replaces the internal version.
