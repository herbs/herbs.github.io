For December's updates to the epstopdf package for MacTeX (TeX Live) 2024 and later. A document describing the changes to eps & tiff conversion, etc., using pdflatex. There are changes to the texmf.cnf file for 2024 when that method is used instead of `--shell-escape' as well as an update to the construction of the epstopdf.cfg file for automatic conversion of .tif(f) to .png files.
