Implementation of latexmk 4.76 for TeXShop. All files necessary to update to latexmk 4.76 from a previous version; includes latexmk 4.76. The latexmk Perl Program itself has been updated. There is a folder with updated engines for TeXShop 4.66 and later.  There has been a small change to the `latexmkrcDONTedit' file to be placed in the `~/Library/TeXShop/bin/tslatexmk' folder replacing the version there. Then (re)move the `~/Library/TeXShop/bin/latexmkrcedit', if it exists, and run one of the latexmk based engine once to recreate a new copy. Then copy any personal changes you have made in the old version to the newly created version. Engines allow a project configuration file called platexmkrc in the same directory as the project root file. The updated engine files that use TeXShop's `parameter' declaration from the 4.54 distribution are included. There may be additional files in the folders so don't just replace folders, copy only the files needed. NOTE: The shell used for these engines (and a couple of support files) has been changed to `sh` from `bash` to be executable on future versions of macOS which will remove `bash`.
